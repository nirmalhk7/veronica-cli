# veronica-cli
> Your faithful CLI Assistant.

I'm planning a lot of new things, please make sure you check out the Issue section.

## Installation Instructions
<!-- TODO: This needs more work -->
- Download the latest version from the Releases tab. Unzip it at any location in your desktop.
- Unzip it at any location of your choice.
- Add below line to your `.bashrc`:
```
alias veronica=BASE_PATH/veronica
```
Here BASE_PATH is the path where you unzipped Veronica to.
